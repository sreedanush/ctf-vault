# 🌍 OSINT – Category Overview

Welcome to the OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) section of this CTF repository.
This category challenges you to investigate, analyze, and extract information from publicly available sources — often through images, metadata, landmarks, websites, or digital clues.

OSINT exercises test your ability to think like an investigator:
👉 connect clues, tools, geography, logic, and pattern recognition.

# 🔎 What OSINT Challenges Typically Involve
1. Image Investigation

Extract meaningful clues from images:

buildings and architecture

road signs, geography, coastline

vegetation & climate

satellite views / Google Maps comparisons

shadows, time-of-day estimates

camera reflections, light poles, pavement types

OSINT image analysis often feels like being a digital detective.

# 2. Metadata & File Information

Challenges may require pulling information from:

EXIF metadata

GPS coordinates

camera model signatures

timestamps

steganographic hints

# Tools often used:

exiftool
strings
file
identify (ImageMagick)

# 3. Geolocation (GeoOSINT)

You may identify locations using:

aerial patterns

building geometry

landmarks

satellite imagery

street layouts

vegetation density

regional design styles

# Tools:

Google Earth

Google Maps

Yandex

OpenStreetMap

SunCalc

Mapillary

# 4. Web Footprinting & Digital Trails

Sometimes OSINT challenges involve exploring:

leaked websites

archived pages

user profiles

GitHub repos

social media clues

whois/domain footprints

# Tools:

waybackmachine
whois
crt.sh
hunter.io

# 5. Logic-Based Clue Hunting

Many OSINT tasks require:

following a breadcrumb sequence

interpreting riddles

recognizing patterns in images

matching shapes/landmarks

analyzing background objects (cars, poles, etc.)

It’s less hacking and more intelligence gathering + deduction.

# 🧰 Useful Tools for OSINT
