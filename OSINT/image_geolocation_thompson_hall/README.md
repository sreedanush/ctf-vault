# 🛰️ OSINT Challenge – Identifying Thompson Hall (GMU)
# #️⃣ 1. Initial Image Analysis

From the provided photo, we observed:

A large parking lot directly below the camera

A white Reston Limousine shuttle bus

A modern glass building on the right

A brick residential-style building with a red “113” sign on the roof (left side)

A major road between the camera and the buildings

Multiple crosswalks, lamp posts, and sidewalk geometry

# The presence of:

On-campus shuttle

Dense academic-style architecture

GMU shuttle brand
…confirmed this was George Mason University: Fairfax Campus.

# #️⃣ 2. Identifying the Left-Side Building – Rogers Hall

The building on the left had distinguishing features:

Red “113” numbering

Multi-story student housing architecture

Brown brick with modern glass corners

Distinct shape with a small courtyard behind it

# Using Google Maps + Yandex:

✔ It matched Rogers Hall, a well-known GMU housing building.

This told us:

Our camera  is facing Rogers Hall across a road and parking lot

# #️⃣ 3. Identifying the Right-Side Building

The glass-paneled building on the right had:

Two-story modern design

Strong horizontal beam architecture

High window count

Connected pathways toward the Mason Pond road

# Matching this with campus maps revealed:

✔ It is Exploratory Hall (the main science/engineering building).

If left = Rogers Hall
and right = Exploratory Hall
→ the camera must be positioned somewhere between the two but elevated.

# #️⃣ 4. Analyzing Camera Position & Elevation

From the picture:

The camera was at second-floor height

Directly above a staff parking lot

With a railing/wall that curves downward

With a clear line of sight crossing over Patriot Circle road

This particular viewpoint is not possible from:

❌ Rogers Hall
❌ Eastern Shore Hall
❌ Any dorm buildings
❌ Exploratory Hall
❌ Planetary Hall

Only one building sits:

Behind a small parking lot

Facing Rogers Hall across the road

Has a slightly elevated 2nd-floor window line

Matches the angle and sidewalk geometry perfectly

# That building is:

🎯 Thompson Hall
#️⃣ 5. Final Location Confirmation (Triangulation)
✔ Thompson Hall has:

A faculty/staff lot on the south side

The same sidewalk curvature as in the image

The same grassy divider

The same view toward Exploratory Hall

The exact angle toward Rogers Hall’s “113” sign

The correct elevation for a second-floor shot

Everything aligned perfectly.

🧠 Why This OSINT Worked

We combined:

Reverse image search

Building architecture comparison

Light pole & road geometry

Parking lot layout

Housing building identification

Line-of-sight and elevation analysis

Crosswalk and curve matching

Satellite triangulation

A very clean and professional OSINT geolocation workflow.
