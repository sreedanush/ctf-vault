# CRYPTOCURRENCY

This directory acts as a vault for different types of cryptography-based CTF
challenges. Each subfolder contains the methods, logic, and scripts used to
break or decode challenge-specific encryption schemes.

The goal is to keep every solved crypto technique—whether it's XOR streams,
custom ciphers, strange keystream generators, or non-standard algorithms—in one
place so they can be reused, referenced, or adapted in future challenges.
